You need autodesks fbxsdk. I don't know which fucking version.

When compiling, make sure u have the following include path  
`C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2020.0.1\include`  
And the library path  
`C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2020.0.1\lib\vs2017\x64\release`  
And additional dependencies  
`libfbxsdk.lib`
